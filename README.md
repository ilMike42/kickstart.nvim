# My NeoVim Dotfiles

Just a [kickstart.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim) setup, but modularized and customized based on my personal preference and needs.

## Overview

kickstart.nvim is a starter configuration for Neovim, providing a basic setup to get you up and running quickly. This fork includes my customizations and tweaks for an optimized development environment.

## Installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ilMike42/kickstart.nvim.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim
```

## License

This project follows the same license as the original kickstart.nvim. Feel free to use and modify the configurations.
